=======

sketches for savannah fund metrics project
Demo here: <http://auremoser.github.io/savannah/>

###What is this?
This is a simple chart and card view of the savannah fund data, to track startup costs for first-year companies in the following countries. 

###How does it work?
* [fusion chart here](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1mDymICnSNUI_mrSbQhSyLR_XHaW4g6ud2Tn4DijC) answers are mapped to this page, but the layout differs
* Basic totals and a range of barcharts display on this page
* tooltips show values and everything alphabetizes by country
* at right (or below, depending on your screen size), small summary cards report the remaining form info by team member (again, alphabetical)
